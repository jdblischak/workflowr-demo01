<!-- The file analysis/chunks.R contains chunks that define default settings
shared across the workflowr files. -->
```{r read-chunk, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("chunks.R")
```

<!-- Update knitr chunk options -->
```{r knitr-opts-chunk, include=FALSE}
```

<!-- Insert the date the file was last updated -->
```{r last-updated, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Session information

<!-- Insert the session information into the document -->
```{r session-info}
```
